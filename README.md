# 📍 Waypoint-Based Navigation with Easing

This Unity project showcases a smooth waypoint-following system for a sphere object using vector maths (no physics engine). It loops through waypoints with ease-in and ease-out motion.

## 🎯 Objective

Guide a sphere through four waypoints in a loop, slowing into each waypoint and accelerating out using custom logic.

## ✨ Features

- Four moveable waypoints in 3D space
- Loop path: A → B → C → D → A
- Smooth easing in/out at each waypoint
- Real-time waypoint movement support
- Adjustable speed via Inspector

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Unity (Version 2022 or later)
- C# Scripting

## 📂 How to Use

1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Set the `Waypoints` array in the PathFollower script.
3. Play the scene to watch the object loop through the points.
